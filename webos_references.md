# What does this file mean? What is it for?

It is just a sloppy way of having my favorites about webos available to me (and anyone else who is interested)

My intention is not for this file ```webos_references.md``` to be organized or pretty, just to be a kind of "repository of useful links for this specific project". 

## This file is only for references that I can use here (or not)

Here you will find documents that I use as reference for research
they are not following any criteria and can be a mess

Just because the documentation is here does not mean that the feature it explains will be in the next version,
it means that it has piqued my interest and I would like to know what it is and how it works.
There are no spoilers or guarantees that anything will be in the next version.
